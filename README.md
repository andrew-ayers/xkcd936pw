XKCD-936 Password Generator Shell Script

See the file "xkcd-936-password-via-cli.txt" for full details...

In short - this is a small (well - if you don't include the word list) shell script to generate XKCD-936 (https://xkcd.com/936/) 
style pass-phrases.

To use: Place the script in a convenient place on your PATH, make it executable, then invoke it - you'll get a four-word
pass-phrase back, generated from a list of 5000 words (included in the script).

Enjoy!
